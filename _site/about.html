        <p class="top-left">Our company was founded by passionate guides more than 20 years ago, <br>
          and guiding continues to be the heart and soul of who we are. <br>
          We require that all of our guides undergo extensive safety training before officially <br>
          joining us a mountain and/or glacier guide. Our certified and knowledgeable guides live <br>
          and breathe the outdoor adventure life. They use their extensive mountaineering and trekking <br>
          training to safely lead travelers on adventures, and to pursue personal outdoor challenges.</p>
        <p class="bottom-right">We are proud to have guides from different nationalities on the team. <br>
          English is the primary language spoken on all of our tours but, collectively, our guides speak over a dozen. <br>

    <h1>Adventure travel expert</h1>
    <p>
        After creating the EverestTravel in Iceland in 1994, we saw how important it is to offer innovative and safe experiences 
        to travellers in Iceland.
        Our diverse selection of adventures lets you immerse in the world’s pure wilderness.<br>
        <br>
        Along with enjoying activities out in nature, we are strong advocates of conserving the precious Icelandic
        nature that we work in all year long.
        We design tours that take travellers on safe, fun and environmentally conscious outdoor adventures that showcase 
        the awe-inspiring beauty of Iceland. Whether you want to go hiking, backpacking, trekking, ice climbing, on a glacier walk,
        mountain climbing, skiing, on an expedition or for a mountaineering course in almost every country, we’ve got you covered!<br>
        <br>
        <br>Our focus on protecting world’s nature, while providing quality services and small group experiences, 
        are what make us world's best adventure travel experts.<br>
