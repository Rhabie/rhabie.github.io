    <h1>Adventure travel expert</h1>
    <p>
        After creating the EverestTravel in Iceland in 1994, we saw how important it is to offer innovative and safe experiences 
        to travellers in Iceland.
        Our diverse selection of adventures lets you immerse in the world’s pure wilderness.<br>
        <br>
        Along with enjoying activities out in nature, we are strong advocates of conserving the precious Icelandic
        nature that we work in all year long.
        We design tours that take travellers on safe, fun and environmentally conscious outdoor adventures that showcase 
        the awe-inspiring beauty of Iceland. Whether you want to go hiking, backpacking, trekking, ice climbing, on a glacier walk,
        mountain climbing, skiing, on an expedition or for a mountaineering course in almost every country, we’ve got you covered!<br>
        <br>
        <br>Our focus on protecting world’s nature, while providing quality services and small group experiences, 
        are what make us world's best adventure travel experts.<br>
